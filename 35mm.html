Kodak first entroduced 35mm film for still images in 1934 and it was called 135 film. 135 is 
not an important number, its just the number that was assigned to the film type. The film is located 
inside a type of cartridge that is loaded into the camera.

This is how film is loaded into most 35mm cameras. Once the film is loaded into the camera like this 
you are ready to take pictures (just make sure you close the camera so the film is not exposed to light).
